# GoodHood-Testing
community action app

Good hood is a community message board that allows people in the community to make annoucements about things that are going on in the neighborhood, start discussions about local topics, post local jobs and post local volunteer oppurtunities. 

I beleive the application is set up correctly for the most part I'm having difficulty trying to create a post request that will send the form data to the database and post the form data to the home page. 

the web site is segmented into 3 types of forms: volunteer form, contract form, annoucement form. for the sake of learning and efficiency 
I'm only focused on getting the annoucement form to work. I figure once that is running I can just copy and paste the same code for the other two forms. 

how do I send the form data that is on the index.handlebars page as a post request to the data base? 
how can I get that data to display on the index.handlebars page?
